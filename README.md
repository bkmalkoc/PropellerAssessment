The application should use a network client to pull down the JSON data for use in the
application on startup and use the data to prefill the event list.

Each event list item should display the following:
● Event id
● Medication name

The event list should be scrollable and sorted by date with the most recent event appearing at
the top of the list.

The app should contain a method to input a new event and display it in the existing list.

● Medication name
● Timestamp
